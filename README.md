Link to Public Miro: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM73AdYc=/?share_link_id=542659522333
12. Product Backlog items - 11 total (see Miro)
13. User story for each (see Miro), 
14. Ordering in priority (see Miro)<br>
Rationale for ordering
    - 1st, ensure dependencies are complete (e.g. cannot rate a post until a post is created)
    - 2nd, make it easy to provide amazing, quality content targeted to our primary stakeholder (i.e. we want Mya to love our product) 
    - 3rd, add incremental value with additional features to enhance Mya's experience 
    - 4th, satisfy needs of other stakeholder types (e.g. make sure Mya's mom and Noch love our product too)
15. Definition of Ready <br> 
    - Title: the user story has a relevant title 
    - User story opening sentence: the user story's opening statement directly relates to the content in the format 
    As a ___ (name/type of key stakeholder where possible), I want ____ (what), So that ___(why)
    - Additional details: list of backlog specific items and dependencies that area required before starting
    - Acceptance criteria: all team members have a mutual understanding of the story and the goal
    - Estimated in story points: Points should be from 1-3 based on effort as determined by dev members. For reference: 3 is the largest PBI allowed (e.g. intial set up), 1 is a minor feature (e.g. add rating) 
    It is encouraged to have backlog items at 1 but this is not required
    - Key functional tests (if required): Identify an input that will provide a desired outcome (e.g. shows the star rating out of 5)
    - Dependencies ready: List of any unique dependencies with confirmation of done (e.g. admin rights required for editing)
15. Estimates in relative size units - See Miro
16. Whole team relative size: 20 Total Points across 11 backlog items<br>
Activity Name: **Agile Animals**  
    - Identify dev team skill sets
    - Group PBI into 3 classifications (1 small, 3 largest)
    - Classification done by dev team based on dev team experience/skill set not external benchmarks
    - Any PBI larger than 3 were decomposed as re-classified
17. Confirmation Dev-only estimates:<br>
